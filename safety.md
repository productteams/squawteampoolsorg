	<strong>Safety is everything.<br>
Our kids use TeamPools too.</strong><br>
</div>

<div>
As parents, we worry about our kids and your kids. That's why we've built stringent safety measures into everything we do at TeamPools. <br>

It all starts with the fact that this is a service designed to carry kids. From the way we recruit and screen TEAMPOOLS CareDrivers, to requiring our drivers to be members of the TrustLine registry, to our TEAMPOOLSRules, safety is kind of our obsession. All CareDrivers must pass a highly selective 15-point certification process before they can drive your kids. If we wouldn't trust them to drive our own kids, we won't put yours in their care. 
<br>


Before the ride: <br>
<br>
Unique driver requirements that include 5+ years childcare experience

<br>
During the ride:
<br>
A personalized code word you and your child create that CareDrivers confirm upon pickup 
You can track your child's ride live via the TEAMPOOLS app
Zendrive partnership to monitor driving behavior and ensure CareDrivers are focused, in control, and not texting or talking on the phone while a kid is in the car
