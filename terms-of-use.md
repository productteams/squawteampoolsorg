Terms of Use<br>
<br>
Last updated:  January 1st, 2017<br>
<br>
The following terms of use (“Terms of Use”) constitute a binding legal agreement between you and TeamPools, Inc.  (“TeamPools”, “we”, or other first person pronouns).  These Terms govern your use of our website, www.TeamPool.org and (“Site”), our mobile applications (“Applications”) which include our messaging Apps("MessagingApps") and smart phone Apps ( IOS and Android applications) and your use and participation in any related services provided through either (the “Services”). If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, do not use the Services.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
These Terms of Use incorporate by reference our [our Privacy Policy, our TeamPoolsRules, our Pricing and Payment Terms], and any other policies that are provided to you by us and applicable to the Services.<br>
<br>
 

TEAMPOOLS DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER. IT IS UP TO INDEPENDENT, THIRD PARTY DRIVERS OR VEHICLE OPERATORS TO OFFER TRANSPORTATION SERVICES THAT ARE ARRANGED THROUGH USE OF OUR SERVICES. TEAMPOOLS  OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO ARRANGE SUCH THIRD PARTY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OR ACT IN ANY WAY AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.<br>
<br>
 

These Terms can feel like a legal document because, well, it is a legal document. If you're going to use our Application and/or Services, we recommend you read it, maybe even twice, because we want you to gain comfort and confidence in the agreement (and we know you are looking for some reading material to put you to sleep). As an aside, some of the terms that follow may be in bold or all caps (or both). This means that it is really important (well, that’s what we took away from the longer explanation our lawyers gave us). So pay attention.<br>

 <br>

1.     Services.  TEAMPOOLS provides a platform to connect individuals who need transportation services (“Arrangers”) for(i) select family members, and/or, if you elect, (ii) other riders (“Account Passengers”) with whom you associate your account so that you are legally authorized to schedule rides on their behalf or invite them to participate in your ride (collectively, “Riders”) with drivers authorized to provide transportation services using their own vehicles (“Drivers”). Sometimes, Affiliates may use the Services to arrange “Rides” (as defined below) for their students and clients, provided that they are legally authorized to do so by the legal guardians of such Riders. TEAMPOOLS’s platform also allows Arrangers and Drivers to communicate with each other and contract with each other, and may allow for Arrangers to provide feedback about Drivers.  CHILDREN MAY NOT USE OUR APPLICATION, SITE OR SERVICES. We refer to each one-way transportation trip as a “Ride” in these Terms. Arrangers, Drivers and other visitors to the TEAMPOOLS Properties are referred to collectively as “Users”. Based on your role as a Driver or Arranger, certain Supplemental Terms apply.  The Arranger Supplemental Terms can be found here and are incorporated by reference herein for any Arrangers. By agreeing to these Terms, Arrangers shall be subject to and bound by the Arranger Supplemental Terms.  The Driver Supplemental Terms can be found here and are incorporated by reference herein for any Driver.

The following Arbitration Agreement does NOT apply to Drivers.  Instead, Drivers shall be subject to the Dispute Resolution provision set forth in the Driver Supplemental Terms, found here.<br><br>

a.   Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by TEAMPOOLS that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and TEAMPOOLS, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.<br>
<br>
b. Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.  Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to TEAMPOOLS should be sent to: 1933 South Broadway, Suite 1144, Los Angeles, CA 90007.  After the Notice is received, you and TEAMPOOLS may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and TEAMPOOLS do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.<br>
<br>
c.  Arbitration Rules.  Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.<br>
<br>
d.  Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration: If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.<br>
<br>
e.  Time Limits.  If you or TEAMPOOLS pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.<br>
<br>
f.  Authority of Arbitrator.  If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and TEAMPOOLS, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and TEAMPOOLS.<br>
<br>
g. Waiver of Jury Trial.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and TEAMPOOLS in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND TEAMPOOLS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.<br>
<br>
h.  Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.<br>
<br>
i.   Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.<br>
<br>
j.  Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.<br>
<br>
k. Right to Waive.  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.<br>
<br>
l.  Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.<br>
<br>
m.   Small Claims Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or TEAMPOOLS may bring an individual action in small claims court.<br>
<br>
n.  Emergency Equitable Relief.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.<br>
<br>
o.  Courts.  In any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles County, California, for such purpose.  <br>
<br>

<br>
 
Driver Supplemental Terms.  These Driver Supplemental Terms of Service (the “Driver Terms”) are intended to supplement the Terms of Use for TEAMPOOLS and apply to all Drivers authorized to use the TEAMPOOLS Properties for the purpose of providing transportation services. <br>

 <br>

TEAMPOOLS does not provide transportation services, and is not a transportation carrier.  TEAMPOOLS neither owns, leases, nor operates any vehicles.  TEAMPOOLS’s business is solely limited to offering a tool for Arrangers and Drivers to connect for the purpose of transporting Riders, in exchange for which TEAMPOOLS receives a contractually-agreed upon amount of the fee paid by Arrangers to the Drivers.  <br>
<br>
 

By agreeing to these Terms, Driver represents he/she is in the independent business of providing transportation services, and understands and intends to create the relationship of principal and independent contractor and not that of employer and employee.  Driver is not an employee, agent, joint venturer, franchisee, affiliate, or partner of TEAMPOOLS for any purpose.  In addition, for Drivers, a “Ride” will begin at the point the Driver indicates their departure for their first Ride and continue until the transportation service is completed after drop off for such Ride.<br>

 <br>
<br>
1. Driver’s Obligations.<br>
<br>
In consideration for authorization to use the TEAMPOOLS Services to arrange Rides, Driver represents and agrees that they will comply with the following contractual obligations:<br>
<br>
a.  Driver must be at least 23 years of age, have a valid driver’s license and all other required licenses, certifications, permits, approvals and authority to provide independent transportation services to third parties in all jurisdictions in which Driver operates.  To ensure Driver’s compliance with all legal requirements, Driver must provide written copies of all such licenses, permits and other legal prerequisites prior to the date any Rides are performed.  Thereafter, Driver must submit to TEAMPOOLS current copies of such licenses, permits, etc., as they are renewed.  To ensure all such permits and licenses remain current, TEAMPOOLS shall, upon request, be entitled to review such licenses and permits from time to time.<br>
<br>
b.   Driver must provide TEAMPOOLS with proof of insurance in appropriate coverage amounts as described below.<br>
<br>
c.   Driver must have a clean driving record with (i) no more than one (1) point during the prior 3 years, (ii) no DUIs, drug-related moving violations, or extreme violations in the last 7 years (e.g., hit-and-run, vehicle-related felonies), and no accidents in which they were deemed to have been at fault.<br>
<br>
d.   Drivers must have a clean criminal background and must have never been convicted of any of the following: a violent crime, a sexual offense, theft, property damage, a felony, a drug-related offense, child abuse, a misdemeanor, felony or other crime.<br>
<br>
e.   Driver shall consent to TEAMPOOLS conducting a comprehensive background check which may include fingerprinting, and will provide all necessary information to TEAMPOOLS so that the background check can be timely and accurately completed.  TEAMPOOLS may deny Driver access to the Services based on the results of the background check to the extent permitted by applicable law.<br>
<br>
f.   Driver acknowledges they have fully read and accept the then-current TEAMPOOLSRules. Drivers agree to adhere to the TEAMPOOLSRules and the Terms, and all applicable laws and regulations governing the provision of transportation services in connection with any Rides arranged using the Services.
<br>
g.  Drivers may only use the vehicle(s) approved for use by TEAMPOOLS (each an “Approved Vehicle”) for transporting Riders.<br>
<br>
h.  Drivers must own, lease, or have all other necessary rights, permits, licenses and certifications to lawfully operate the Approved Vehicle(s), and the Approved Vehicle(s) must be in good operating condition and meet industry appearance and safety standards and all applicable statutory and state department of motor vehicle requirements. All Approved Vehicles must first pass the Public Utilities Commission ("PUC") -required 19-point vehicle inspection and Driver must provide proof of such successful inspection.  Driver must notify TEAMPOOLS of any change or addition to the vehicle Driver intends to use to provide transportation services under these Terms by submitting to TEAMPOOLS photos, an updated description and vehicle registration and proof of inspection for any previously unidentified vehicle.  The purpose of this provision is to enable TEAMPOOLS to determine whether Driver’s vehicle(s) meets industry standards and to comply with applicable law.<br>
<br>
i.   Driver must not make any misrepresentation about TEAMPOOLS or the Services.  Drivers may not affirmatively solicit Arrangers or Riders for their own businesses, but are otherwise free to market their businesses, including while transporting Riders, as they see fit.<br>
<br>
j.  Drivers must transport a Rider directly to the predetermined destination selected by the Arranger.<br>
<br>
k.  For security and identification purposes, to ensure the Rider is able to verify the Driver’s identity, Driver must wear the provided TEAMPOOLS t-shirt and display the TEAMPOOLS trade-dress on their cars while picking up and transporting Riders.  TEAMPOOLS shall have no right to require Driver to display TEAMPOOLS’s name, logo or colors on Driver’s vehicle(s) or to require that Driver wear a uniform or any other clothing displaying TEAMPOOLS’s name, logo or colors, beyond what is necessary for security and identification purposes as expressly stated in these Terms or required by law.  Nothing in these Terms shall limit Driver’s right to display Driver’s own business name, logo or colors on Driver’s vehicles or Driver’s apparel, to the extent doing so does not interfere with the foregoing contractual obligations.<br>
<br>
l.   Driver agrees that he/she shall maintain a professional appearance consistent with industry standards while transporting Riders.<br>
<br>
m.  In order to comply with safety regulations imposed by the PUC:<br>
<br>
i.  TEAMPOOLS has a zero-tolerance policy with regard to device usage during Rides. Driver may not use his/her phone or other devices for texting or voice calls for any purpose while transporting a Rider, even with Bluetooth, a speakerphone or headset, except if contacted by TEAMPOOLS or an Arranger, in which event Driver agrees to pull safely over to the side of the road and answer the call or return TEAMPOOLS’s call. <br>
<br>
ii.   Driver must immediately notify TEAMPOOLS and the appropriate Arranger in the event of any delay or an emergency or other event that may threaten the health or safety of a Rider.  In the event that a Rider has a health emergency during the Ride, Driver must call 911 or drive the Rider to the nearest hospital, as appropriate, and then contact TEAMPOOLS.<br>
<br>
iii.   Driver must have their current cell phone number listed on their account at all times.<br>
<br>
iv.   If and when applicable, Driver must install booster seats prior to pick up.<br>
<br>
v.   No adults over the age of 18 except for the Driver, or except for the Rider’s Arranger or an adult authorized by the Rider’s Arranger, shall be present in any Approved Vehicle(s) during a Ride.<br>
<br>
vi.   Driver agrees not to discriminate or harass anyone on the basis of race, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital status, age or sexual orientation.<br>
<br>
vii.  Driver shall comply with TEAMPOOLS’s zero-tolerance policy against drug and alcohol use during Rides.<br>
<br>
viii.  Driver shall comply with TEAMPOOLS’s zero-tolerance policy against physical contact between Drivers and Riders.<br>
<br>
n.   During a Ride, Driver will not interfere with the operation of the Application or disable the collection of location-based information from the Driver’s mobile device.<br>
<br>
o.   Driver will be solely responsible for compliance with any applicable state, federal or local, laws, rules, regulations governing driving and the provision of transportation services, including with respect to any limitations on driving hours and any requirements governing the condition of motor vehicles. Without limiting the provisions of Section 3(e) of the Terms of Use, and to ensure compliance with the foregoing provision, Driver consents to and hereby authorizes TEAMPOOLS (directly or through a service provider) to collect and store driving and other location-based data while the Application is open or being used.<br>
<br>
p.   Failure to comply with the foregoing shall constitute a material breach of the Terms.<br>
<br>
2. TEAMPOOLS and Driver may be, or are, engaged in similar agreements with others.  Nothing in these Terms shall preclude TEAMPOOLS from doing business with other independent transportation service providers, nor preclude Driver from entering into contracts similar to these Terms with any peer-to-peer, ridesharing, or lead generation providers.  TEAMPOOLS neither has nor reserves the right to restrict Driver from performing other transportation services for any company, business or individual, or from being engaged in any other occupation or business.  However, Driver shall not while these Terms are in effect, use his/her relationship with TEAMPOOLS (or the information gained from use of the Services) to divert or attempt to divert any Arrangers or Riders from using the TEAMPOOLS Properties to a company that provides services in competition with TEAMPOOLS.  For safety reasons, during any Ride, Driver agrees not to run smartphone applications for other peer-to-peer, ridesharing or lead generation providers.<br>
<br>
3.     Subject to the provisions of the Terms expressly set forth herein, Driver shall be solely responsible for determining how to perform the Rides arranged using the Services.  Drivers agree to fully perform Rides in a timely, efficient and safe manner and in accordance with all Arranger and Rider specifications.  The provisions of these Terms reserving authority in TEAMPOOLS have been inserted solely to achieve compliance with federal, state, or local laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof.  Except as to those provisions, TEAMPOOLS shall have no right to, and shall not, control the manner or prescribe the method, manner, or means Drivers use to complete Rides.<br>
<br>
4.   Except as specifically set forth in these Terms, Driver is solely responsible for all costs and expenses incident to Driver performing Rides under these Terms, including, but not limited to, costs of fuel, fuel taxes, wages, employment taxes, excise taxes, permits of all types, gross revenue taxes, road taxes, equipment use fees and taxes, licensing, insurance coverage, unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation contributions, and any other tax, fine or fee imposed or assessed against the equipment or you by any state, local, or federal authority as a result of an action by Driver or Driver’s personnel in the performance of Rides pursuant to these Terms.  Failure to comply with these the foregoing shall constitute a material breach of the Terms.<br>
<br>
5.  Driver is not required to purchase, lease or rent any products, equipment or services from TEAMPOOLS as a condition of entering into these Terms.<br>
<br>
6.     Ride Contracts. <br>
After registering your Account, you will be able to view, through the Service, rides that Arrangers have requested in your approximate geographic region or another region you select. TEAMPOOLS does not guarantee that any Driver will receive any minimum number of Ride offers. From time to time, you may also receive notifications via text, email or the Service from TEAMPOOLS indicating a Ride opportunity. This notification will include general information about the desired Ride, such as the neighborhoods of the pick-up and drop-off locations and an estimate of the applicable Ride Fees. Other Drivers may also receive such notifications.<br>

 <br>

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have no pre-existing obligations or commitments (and will not assume or otherwise undertake any obligations or commitments) that would be in conflict or inconsistent with or that would hinder your performance of your obligations under these Terms or your Ride Contracts; and (ii) Rides will be performed in a thorough and professional manner, with the requisite training, background, experience, technical knowledge and skills necessary to perform Rides.<br>
<br>
 

The provision of Rides involves a direct contractual relationship between an Arranger and a Driver, and Arrangers and Drivers agree that they will contract directly with one another for the provision of Rides. You, and (if applicable) on behalf of your Rider acknowledge and agree that this contractual relationship is formed when a Driver agrees to provide a Ride through the Services. In such instance, subject to the Driver’s and Arranger’s right to cancel such Ride during the cancellation period described in the Pricing and Payment Terms, the Arranger agrees to pay for and the Driver agrees to perform, the Ride in accordance with the following terms and agreements: (1) these Terms, (2) the Pricing and Payment terms, (3) the Ride Description, and (4) the Ride Fees (collectively, a “Ride Contract”). You also agree with, and that each of your Ride Contracts will include, without limitation, the following terms:<br>
<br>
 <br>

 - Driver shall perform Rides for Arrangers and Riders in a timely, professional and workman-like manner, in accordance with the applicable Ride Description, the TEAMPOOLSRules and generally accepted industry standards.<br>
<br>
 <br>

 - Upon the completion of the Ride, Arranger is responsible for and shall pay any and all applicable Ride Fees.<br>
<br>
 
<br>
 - Driver acknowledges that TEAMPOOLS does not, in any way, direct or control Driver’s provision of Rides to Arrangers or Riders.<br>
<br>
 
<br>
 - Driver agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend TEAMPOOLS from any and all claims arising out of or related to their Ride Contract, including but not limited to claims arising out of the provision of Rides by Driver to Riders.<br>
<br>

 TEAMPOOLS offers a technology platform to provide the Services and is not involved in the provision of Rides. TEAMPOOLS’s sole responsibility with respect to Ride Contracts is limited to (i) facilitating the availability of the Services, and (ii) serving as the limited authorized agent of the Drivers for the purpose of accepting payments from Arrangers on behalf of the Drivers and transmitting such payments to the Drivers as described herein.<br>

 <br>

7.     Fees: Driver shall be entitled to a fee for each completed Ride provided as a result of Driver’s use of the Services, as if further described in the Pricing and Payment Terms. Driver also agrees to pay TEAMPOOLS a fee for arranging the Ride. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
8.     Insurance.<br>
<br>
a.   Drivers must possess insurance in all types of coverage and amounts required by law to provide the transportation services described in these Terms.<br>
<br>
b.   Driver must have a valid policy of liability insurance (in coverage amounts equal to or greater than all applicable legal requirements) covering the operation of the Approved Vehicle(s) to cover any anticipated losses related to such Driver’s provision of Rides to Riders.  Driver must provide proof of insurance to TEAMPOOLS before participating in the Services.<br>
<br>
c.   Driver must be named or scheduled on their personal insurance policy covering the Approved Vehicle(s), and must also name any of their personnel that are authorized to use the Services.<br>
<br>
d.   TEAMPOOLS shall maintain all insurance it is required by law to maintain in connection with the Rides arranged using the Services.<br>
<br>
e.   Industrial Injury Insurance.  Driver shall be responsible for maintaining appropriate industrial injury insurance to the extent required by law.  If permitted by law, Driver may choose to insure Driver and any personnel against industrial injuries by maintaining occupational accident insurance in place of workers’ compensation insurance.<br>
<br>
f.   Failure to comply with these insurance requirements shall constitute a material breach of the Terms.<br>
<br>
9.    Dispute Resolution—PLEASE READ.<br>
<br>
a.     MANDATORY AND EXCLUSIVE ARBITRATION:  TEAMPOOLS and Driver mutually agree to resolve any justiciable disputes between them exclusively through final and binding arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit in court.  This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) and shall apply to any and all claims arising out of or relating to the Terms or these Driver Terms, Driver’s classification as an independent contractor, Driver’s provision of Rides under the Terms or these Driver Terms (including any Rides provided by Driver’s personnel), the payments received by Driver and/or its personnel for providing Rides under the Terms or these Driver Terms, the termination of the terms or these Driver Terms, and all other aspects of Driver’s relationship with TEAMPOOLS, past or present, whether arising under federal, state or local statutory and/or common law.<br>
<br>
(a)    If either Party wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating Party must notify the other Party in writing via email, certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period.  This demand for arbitration must include (1) the name and address of the Party seeking arbitration, (2) a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim, and (3) a description of the remedy sought.  Any demand for arbitration by Driver must be delivered to 11415 Deerfield Drive, # 9568 Truckee, CA 96162.  Any demand for arbitration by TEAMPOOLS must be delivered to Driver’s last known address.<br>
<br>
(b)   Class Action Waiver:  Driver and TEAMPOOLS mutually agree that by entering into this agreement to arbitrate, both waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a class action, collective action and/or representative action, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class, collective or representative action (“Class Action Waiver”).  Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement or the AAA Rules, as defined below, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.<br>
<br>
(c)    Driver agrees and acknowledges that entering into this arbitration agreement does not change Driver’s status as an independent contractor in fact or in law, that Driver is not an employee of TEAMPOOLS and that any disputes in this regard shall be subject to arbitration as provided herein.<br>
<br>
(d)   Any arbitration shall be governed by the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), except as follows:<br>
<br>
1.     The arbitration shall be heard by one Arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules.  The Arbitrator shall be an attorney or retired judge with experience in the law underlying the dispute.<br>
<br>
2.     If the Parties cannot otherwise agree on a location for the arbitration, the arbitration shall take place in the county in which Driver provided Rides under the Terms and these Driver Terms.<br>
<br>
3.     Unless applicable law provides otherwise, as determined by the Arbitrator, the Parties agree that TEAMPOOLS shall pay all of the Arbitrator’s fees and costs.<br>
<br>
4.     The Arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties) allowing the Parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each Party to prepare that Party’s claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes.<br>
<br>
5.     Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver, the Arbitrator may award all remedies to which a Party is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, but shall not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have been available in a court of law for the claims presented in arbitration.  The Arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is applicable.<br>
<br>
6.     The Arbitrator may hear motions to dismiss and/or motions for summary judgment and will apply the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions.<br>
<br>
7.     The Arbitrator’s decision or award shall be in writing with findings of fact and conclusions of law.<br>
<br>
8.     Either Driver or TEAMPOOLS may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief on the ground that without such relief the arbitration provided in this Dispute Resolution provision may be rendered ineffectual.<br>
<br>
(e)   Regardless of any other provision in the Terms or these Driver Terms, claims may be brought before and remedies awarded by an administrative agency if applicable law permits access to such an agency notwithstanding the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.<br>
<br>
(f)   The AAA Rules may be found at www.adr.org or by searching for “AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules” using a service such as www.Google.com or www.Bing.com.  Driver may also request a copy directly from TEAMPOOLS.<br>
<br>
(g)    Right To Consult With An Attorney:   Driver has the right to consult with private counsel of Driver’s choice with respect to any aspect of, or any claim that may be subject to, this Dispute Resolution provision.  In the event any portion of this Dispute Resolution provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Dispute Resolution provision will be enforceable.  If the Class Action Waiver is deemed to be unenforceable, Driver and TEAMPOOLS agree that the Dispute Resolution provision is otherwise silent as to any party’s ability to bring a class, collective or representative action in arbitration.<br>
<br>
10.  Term/Termination. TEAMPOOLS and Driver agree that the term of this Agreement does not reflect an uninterrupted service arrangement, as this Agreement guarantees Driver the right to choose when to make himself/herself available and each Ride is treated as a separate service arrangement.  These terms may be terminated by either the Driver or TEAMPOOLS upon seven (7) days’ written notice, or immediately upon written notice in the event of a material breach of the Terms.  What constitutes a material breach is not limited by the express provisions of the Terms.  After notice of termination of the Terms and these Driver Terms, Driver agrees to return the TEAMPOOLS t-shirt, booster seat, and trade dress to TEAMPOOLS within 24 hours.<br>

 <br>

11. Permission to Use Driver Photos. TEAMPOOLS may, or may have a third party photographer contracted by TEAMPOOLS, take photographs of Drivers (“Driver Photos”). You hereby grant TEAMPOOLS all applicable rights, consents and permissions to photograph you or to have a third party service photographer photograph you and to use, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your name and your image and likeness in any Driver Photo of you, in connection with the operation, advertisement or promotion of the Services, without any compensation for, or obligation to pay, you. Such rights, consents and permissions will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms. TEAMPOOLS owns all right, title and interest in all Driver Photos and may use such Driver Photos in any manner in which it sees fit in connection with the Services.<br>
<br>
 
<br>
 
Arranger Supplemental Terms.  These Arranger Supplemental Terms of Service (the “Arranger Terms”) are intended to supplement the Terms of Use for TEAMPOOLS and apply to all Arrangers using the TEAMPOOLS Properties in their capacity as Arrangers.<br>
<br>
1.     Requirement for Arrangers.<br>
<br>
a.     If you are an Arranger, you must fully and accurately complete the account creation form (the “Account Creation Form”), and immediately update the Account Creation Form if there are any changes to this information.<br>
<br>
b.     Arranger must ensure that the Rider is familiar with and follows all applicable rules and guidelines set forth in these Terms and the TEAMPOOLSRules.<br>
<br>
c.     Arranger will inform TEAMPOOLS regarding any health concerns or any specific instructions regarding the pickup or drop-off of the Rider for communication to the Driver.<br>
<br>
d.      Arranger will have and maintain all necessary permissions to enable Driver to pick up Rider from the applicable pickup location and drop-off Rider at the applicable destination.<br>
<br>
e.     We reserve the right to refuse any potential Arranger or to suspend or terminate any Arranger’s approved status at any time, for any reason or no reason.<br>
<br>
f.      You agree not to circumvent our Services to interact with a Driver outside of our Services.<br>
<br>
g.      Arrangers will ensure that all Riders: (1) comply with all TEAMPOOLSRules; and (2) are available at the designated place promptly at the scheduled pick-up time and in the exact location noted on any specific instructions provided by the Arranger. Drivers will wait 5 minutes after the scheduled pickup time before contacting TEAMPOOLS for more information.  In no event shall a Driver be required to wait more than 15 minutes for a Rider.<br>
<br>
h.     We reserve the right to refuse any potential Arranger or Rider or to suspend or terminate any Arranger’s or Rider’s eligibility to obtain Rides at any time, for any reason or no reason.<br>
<br>
2.     How to Arrange a Ride. Arrangers shall arrange Rides for Riders through the Site or Application. Arrangers will provide the necessary descriptive information for the desired Ride through the Service, including, without limitation, (i) the Rider(s) who will be participating in the ride, (ii) the pick-up and drop-off locations, and (iii) the desired pick-up time or drop-off time, and date (collectively, the “Ride Description”).  Arrangers will input their requests prior to any given Ride and TEAMPOOLS will endeavor to match the request with an available Driver. A RIDE REQUESTED IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT A RIDE WILL BE ARRANGED OR PROVIDED. ALL RIDES MUST BE CONFIRMED BY A DRIVER. Although Arrangers will be notified of the matched Driver prior to the Ride, Arrangers acknowledge that Drivers may change prior to a Ride and following such notification to the Arranger.  Arrangers will be presented with an estimation of applicable “Ride Fees” (as such term is defined in the PRICING AND PAYMENT TERMS) before you confirm your request. Through the Services, upon requesting a Ride to be scheduled, you will be contacted by TEAMPOOLS on behalf of a Driver to provide your Ride. You represent and warrant that you have the necessary rights to schedule a Ride on behalf of your Rider.<br>

3.     Promotions. From time to time, we may elect to run or otherwise make available promotional offers, deals and/or codes through Services. We may establish and modify, in our sole discretion, the terms of such offer and suspend or end such offer at any point, with or without notice to you. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reject or refuse to honor any special deal or promotional code you submit to, or otherwise attempt to redeem on, the Application or Services. Promotional codes are generally limited to one use per customer. We may post additional terms of a promotion on the TEAMPOOLS Properties.<br>
<br>
4.     Cancellation of Rides.  There are specific cancellation windows for any Ride and you will be charged if you fail to show and fail to cancel the reservation within the cancellation window. Please see the Pricing and Payment Terms for details on these cancellation periods and applicable fees. TEAMPOOLS reserves the right to charge you cancellation fees and/or no-show fees. Depending on the Rides booked and the circumstances of the cancellation or no-show, such fees range from a flat-fee to the full quoted fare. You hereby authorize any such charges and fees.<br>
<br>
5.      Effect of Termination. After termination or suspension of your status as an Arranger, you may no longer arrange transportation for Riders using the Services.<br>

<br>
6.     Ride Contracts. <br>
<br>
The provision of Rides involves a direct contractual relationship between an Arranger and a Driver, and Arrangers and Drivers agree that they will contract directly with one another for the provision of Rides. You, and (if applicable) on behalf of your Rider acknowledge and agree that this contractual relationship is formed when a Driver agrees to provide a Ride through the Services. In such instance, subject to the Driver’s and Arranger’s right to cancel such Ride during the cancellation period, the Arranger agrees to pay for and the Driver agrees to perform, the Ride in accordance with the following terms and agreements: (1) these Terms, (2) the Pricing and Payment Terms (3) the Ride Description, and (4) the Ride Fees (collectively, a “Ride Contract”). You also agree with, and that each of your Ride Contracts will include, without limitation, the following terms:<br>

 <br>

 - Upon the completion of the Ride, Arranger is responsible for and shall pay the applicable Ride Fees [Pricing and Payment Terms]. Driver will not receive any payment until Arranger pays the Ride Fees and Arranger remains responsible for all applicable Ride Fees.<br>

 <br>

 - Arranger acknowledges that TEAMPOOLS does not, in any way, direct or control Driver’s provision of Rides to Riders.<br>

 <br>

 - Arranger agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend TEAMPOOLS from any and all claims arising out of or related to their Ride Contract, including but not limited to claims arising out of the provision of Rides by Driver to any Rider.<br>
<br>

 TEAMPOOLS offers a technology platform to provide the Services and is not involved in the provision of Rides. TEAMPOOLS’s sole responsibility with respect to Ride Contracts is limited to (i) facilitating the availability of the Services, and (ii) serving as the limited authorized agent of the Drivers for the purpose of accepting payments from Arrangers on behalf of the Drivers and transmitting such payments to the Drivers as described herein.<br>
