Welcome 

There is a post every day here during the teams season. 


teamPOOLS also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [teamPOOL docs][teamPOOLS] for more info on how to get the most out of teamPOOLS.
