Rideline
<p>
Ridelines are only available and accessible to team members. <br>
The only way a team member gains access to the rideline is by a Parent's invitation.  
</p>

Each Team Day (either practice or race).

Team members text in where they want to go. 
They get an immediate text back showing how many Parents and how many seats are available at that location to go to the team event/practice. Once they text back a quick Y or N, their ride is confirmed.
